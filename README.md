# Battleship Project

- **Name**: Andrew Chen
- **Class**: CSCI201 (Principles of Software Development)

This is a multi-threaded networked Battleship game that functions very much like the original game with a few extra features like online chat. You can play multiplayer if you are given the IP address and port of your opponent. You can also play single player if you give the name of a file from the school's website. This program was written entirely from scratch in Java.
